                       Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs in San Francisco, California. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. In 1961, the family moved to Mountain View, California, which became known as "Silicon Valley." Here, Jobs became fascinated in the computer after first seeing one in the Hewlett Packard Explorer Club.

After attending college for a semester, Steve Jobs dropped out and visited India to learn more about Buddhism. After returning to Silicon Valley, he and his friend, Steve Wozniak, founded Apple. Together, they created a new market in the computer industry. Jobs noticed that computers were large and expensive and sought to create a personal computer. The Apple I was the first personal computer, and the companyâ€™s sales took off. However, during the following couple of decades, fierce competition caused Steve Jobs to be removed as CEO of Apple in 1985. His next venture was NeXT, which created a computer that had an intuitive interface, fast processing speeds, and good sound quality. However, the NeXT machine never caught on because it was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers or common software. In 1986, Jobs purchased a small company called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas. Pixar later went on to make movies such as Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, and Monsters, Inc., all of which were box office hits. Meanwhile, Apple was struggling financially due to fierce competition, so they acquired NeXT and, along with it, brought Steve Jobs back into Apple. He then continued to reinvent Apple, leading it to dominate the consumer device market. Later, in the 21st century, he revolutionized Apple by creating products such as the iPod and the iPhone.
