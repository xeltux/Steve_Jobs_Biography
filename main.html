                                        Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs in San Francisco, California. Paul Jobs was a machinist and fixed cars as a hobby. In 1961, the family moved to Mountain View, California, which became known as "Silicon Valley." Here, Jobs became fascinated in the computer after first seeing one in the Hewlett Packard Explorer Club.

                                        After attending college for a semester, Steve Jobs dropped out and visited India to learn more about Buddhism. After returning to Silicon Valley, he and his friend, Steve Wozniak, founded Apple. Together, they created a new market in the computer industry. Jobs noticed that computers were large and expensive and sought to create a personal computer. The Apple I was the first personal computer, and the company's sales took off. However, during the following couple of decades, fierce competition caused Steve Jobs to be removed as CEO of Apple in 1985. His next venture was NeXT, which created a computer that had an intuitive interface, fast processing speeds, and good sound quality. However, the NeXT machine never caught on because it was too costly, had a black-and-white screen, and could not be linked to other computers or common software. In 1986, Jobs purchased a small company called Pixar from filmmaker George Lucas. Pixar later went on to make movies such as Toy Story 2 and A Bug's Life, and Monsters, Inc., all of which were box office hits. Meanwhile, Apple was struggling financially due to fierce competition, so they acquired NeXT and, along with it, brought Steve Jobs back into Apple. He then continued to reinvent Apple, leading it to dominate the consumer device market. Later, in the 21st century, he revolutionized Apple by creating products such as the iPod and the iPhone.

                                        Steven Paul Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California, and was adopted by Paul and Clara Jobs. Growing up, Steve Jobs had only one sibling; Patty. In 1961, the family relocated to Mountain View, California. South of Palo Alto, California, this area was growing into a center for the electronics industry and was therefore named "Silicon Valley." Jobs enjoyed being independent as a child. He showed an early interest in technology and electronics. Not only that, but he often worked in the garage workshop of a neighbor who was employed by the electronics giant Hewlett-Packard. Jobs joined the Hewlett-Packard Explorer Club as well. At the age of twelve, he witnessed engineers demonstrating brand-new things there, and he also saw his first computer. He was fascinated and immediately decided he wanted to work with computers. Jobs attended lectures at the Hewlett-Packard facility while he was still in high school. When he needed some parts to finish a class project, he once bravely asked William Hewlett for them. Hewlett, impressed by the young Jobs, offered him a summer internship at Hewlett-Packard.("Steve Jobs Biography - Life, Family, Story, History, School, Young, Information, Born, College, House, Time, Year")

                                        Jobs reconnected with Stephen Wozniak, a former high school acquaintance who was employed by Hewlett-Packard Company, in the autumn of 1974 after returning to Silicon Valley. Then, in 1976, Jobs and Wozniak decided to create a company after Hewlett Packard rejected Wozniak's new computer logic board. Together, with funds that they acquired from the sales of Wozniak's programmed calculator and Jobs's Volkswagen minibus, the Jobses' family garage was used to build the Apple I. Jobs knew that the personal computer would appeal to a large audience, so he encouraged Wozniak to design an improved model of their previous design. This improvement condensed into the Apple II, which was complete with a keyboard, and had a sleek, molded plastic case manufactured to enclose the unit. While Wozniak was improving the Apple I, Steve Jobs was able to acquire funding, distribution, and publicity for their company. With the completion of the Apple II, which was an instant hit, Apple Computers Inc. made the fastest entry to the Fortune 500 list (for the time). In 1983, Apple offered PepsiCo President John Sculley the job of CEO. Here, Jobs showed his near-messianic belief in the computer revolution when he convinced Sculley to accept the offer by remarking, "Do you want to sell sugar water for the rest of your life?" Then in 1984, Jobs himself marketed a choreographed demonstration of the Macintosh (Mac). However, these first Macs had little support for external software and were under powered for their price. The failure of the Macintosh caused Jobs to be fired from the company after Sculley convinced the board of directors to fire Jobs in 1985. This, however, was not the end of Steve Jobs. He then established his second company, NeXT Inc., which created workstation computers for the educational sector. Although the NeXT computer was renowned for its technical design, it was outclassed by less expensive models made by other companies. Next, Jobs then prioritized the company's breakthrough software system, NEXTSTEP, at the start of the 1990s. Also during this time, in 1986, Jobs purchased a majority stake in Pixar, a computer graphics company. Jobs then proceeded to transform Pixar into a significant animation studio over the ensuing ten years, producing the first full-length feature film to be made. In 1996, Apple was suffering financial losses, and was on the verge of collapse. To try to fix this problem, the Board of Directors at Apple made semiconductor executive Gilbert Amelio the CEO of the company. As CEO, Amelio noticed that a large amount of money had been spent on creating a new OS for their Macintosh systems. As a replacement, Amelio bought Job's company NeXT for $400 million, which brought Steve Jobs back into Apple. Later, in 1977, The Board of Directors promoted Steve Jobs to CEO. Often, he thought about making their Macintosh computers run Windows, however, Jobs believed that Apple, as the only personal computer maker with its own operating system, and was in a unique position to innovate. In 1998, Jobs introduced the iMac, an egg-shaped, one-piece computer that offered high-speed processing at a relatively modest price. The following year, he triumphed once more with the stylish iBook and the G4, a desktop computer sufficiently powerful that it qualified as a supercomputer.

                                        In 2001, Steve Jobs began to reinvent Apple for the 21st century. He started this with iTunes, a software to play music and convert music to the commonly used mp3 format. Then, in the same year, he developed the portable MP3 player known as the iPod, which swiftly overtook its competition. Later, in 2003, Apple introduced the iTunes store, an online store where people can download mp3 copies of songs. On January 9, 2007, Jobs formally changed the company's name to Apple Inc. in acknowledgement of the shift in the company. Also in 2007, Apple introduced the iPhone, a touchscreen telecommunications device with mp3 playing and internet browsing capabilities as well.("Steve Jobs | Biography, Education, Apple, and Facts")

                                        Jobs received a rare type of pancreatic cancer diagnosis in 2003. He postponed surgery for roughly nine months as he experimented with other treatments. After surgery, he continued to have health problems until March 2011, when he died two months after leaving Apple Inc. In 2022, he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom.("Steve Jobs | Biography, Education, Apple, and Facts")
